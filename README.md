card game
Objective：Each player receives three cards and competes to have the strongest hand or to bluff other players into folding. The winner takes the pot.

Gameplay Steps：Use one standard 52-card deck (Jokers removed). There are 2–6 players . Everyone places a small ante  into the pot. And then, each player receives three cards face-down.
On one player's turn, he/she can: 1) fold: give up the round, 2) call: match the current bet, 3) raise: increase the bet amount, 4) view cards: you may choose to look at your cards, 5) compare : pay an extra fee to compare your hand with another player. The loser of the comparison must fold.
After view cards, players can say something (choose your speech strategy / Brag): 1) Be smug (which might scare others) . 2) pretend to be depressed (pretend the card is small) . 3) Sigh honestly (if the card is small, it shows depression) . 4) Be confident honestly (if the card is big, it shows pride) . 5) keep silent
This is a psychological tactic
If more than one player remains at the end, all reveal their cards, and the best hand wins the pot.
